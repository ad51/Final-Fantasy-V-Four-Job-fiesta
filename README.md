# Final-Fantasy-V-Four-Job-fiesta

Simple random generator that gets four randoms jobs for Final Fantasy V. It follows the rules set by the offical Twitter page of the FFV four job fiesta. The primary goal of this program is for those that do not have a Twitter account for whatever reason, but wish to run this challenge. 
I am not affiliated with those that run this event in any way. I have written this for my own needs as I do not wish to create a Twitter account just for this challenge and believe that there might be a good number of people that feel the same way. 
For more information on the Final Fantasy Four Job Fiesta challenge along with the charity run that happens every summer, Follow this link to the offical website. http://fourjobfiesta.com/
